<h1>About me</h1>

<p>My name is Sonam Shahi, and I am from the beautiful country of the Himalayas-Nepal. I can speak Nepalese, Hindi, and English. I moved to Australia in 2015 and currently living with my husband in Sydney. I have a strong affection towards dogs and miss my 13-year-old dog, who is back home. Besides, I am always thinking of ways to help stray dogs back home, whether through donations to social workers who provide shelter to stray dogs or by spreading social media awareness. Before moving to Australia, I lived in Qatar for two years, working for an airline. I love traveling and exploring new places, learning their culture, trying their food, and learning about their history. I got the opportunity to travel to a few countries and meet new people when I lived in Qatar.
 I started my own small online business in 2019, which provides traditional attires to the  Hindu community living in Australia. I am currently utilizing my modeling experience from my teenage years by becoming a model for my own business. I am amazed how IT has helped transform the lives of so many people, including myself. From getting in touch with my family back home to running my online business, IT has played a massive part in transforming my life, and I am looking forward to a great career.
